## This document will summarize the actions taken to complete this project, as well as random thoughts along the way.

1. Blueprint: create Next App to interact with API. Instantiate Github service as NX library (demonstrating principle of code re-use, this service may be used elsewhere in the future).
   --Next app generated. Simply used NRWL/NEXT generator.
   --established github service as NX library for code org and re-use. Template for now.
2. Build serverless endpoint to interact with Github service.
3. Use some tool or other to plug client (verrryyyy rudimentary frontend) with this serverless endpoint.
4. Create the actual Github service method that will do the job we are being asked to do.
5. Looks like we'll want to brush up on recursion. Hurrah.
6. Test solution.
7. Look in to extra credit.
