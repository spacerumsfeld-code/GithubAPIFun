## Welcome

Contained herein is my STS assessment. I'd say it was a good bit of fun, and more than anything I tried to demonstrate proficiency in NX repo organization, whipping up a full-stack app with shared libraried in no time in line with industry standards, and a bit of recursive play, though I really end up returning followers of followers .. and that's it.

## Getting Started

1. clone and pull this repository.
2. run `npm i`
3. run `make dev`
4. Visit localhost:4200 and click the 'get followers' button to interact with the API!
5. ???
6. Profit
